While having Discord Userbots (running an actual bot over a user account that everyone can interact with) was always frowned upon, it appears to be the case that selfbots have gotten out of control, too.

Besides, this bot is pretty broken at this point.

If you still wish to do it, keep in mind:

**This is all at your own risk. If something goes wrong, it's *your* fault. I am not responsible for anything happening when you use my bot in any way.** (I stopped using it myself ages ago.)
